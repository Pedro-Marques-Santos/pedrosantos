Hello, I'm Pedro Marques, a website and app developer. During the day, I work as a systems analyst, where I apply my skills to solve problems and improve processes. At night, I dedicate my time to personal projects, such as [Personality](https://teste-personalidade-mzl5.vercel.app/), an interactive personality test, and EasyRecruiterOn, a recruitment platform that is still in development. [Check out more projects here](/projects/).

## About this blog

This blog is a space where I will share my challenges and learnings in programming. The idea is to document my journey, from the obstacles I face to the solutions I find in my daily work. I haven't decided yet whether I will include aspects of my personal life, but the main focus will be professional. I want to show you, the reader, how I can contribute to your project with my skills and experience.

I believe that the best way to grow in the tech field is by sharing knowledge and learning from the community. That's why this blog will be a place to exchange ideas, tips, and insights about software development, the tools I use, and market trends.

> In short, if I find something useful or interesting, it will probably be here.

In addition to projects and technical challenges, I will also talk about my experience in building a startup and the lessons I have learned in this process. I hope the content here is relevant and inspires you to tackle your own challenges.

**Report Bugs/Suggestions:** If you find any interface or functionality issues, or if you have feedback about my work, please [let me know](mailto:pedromarquesnoot@outlook.com). I'm always open to suggestions and eager to improve!
