## Introduction

For those with limited resources or small business owners looking to test a CRM or idea without heavy investment, **Google Cloud** stands out as an excellent option. The platform's **Virtual Machines (VMs)** are undoubtedly one of the best ways to explore virtual private servers (VPS) and host personal or experimental projects at low cost.

> **In short:** Here's why I highly recommend Google Cloud VMs - and why you should consider them too.

## $300 in Free Credits

The **initial $300 credit**, valid for 90 days, is one of Google Cloud's biggest advantages. It's a valuable opportunity to learn about VPS or cloud computing without spending anything. This credit can be used across all platform services, including **Compute Engine** (where VMs are created), allowing you to test tools that would otherwise be expensive.

## Affordable Hosting Without Sacrificing Viability

One of Google Cloud's greatest strengths is the ability to maintain low costs without completely compromising performance. With smart configurations, you can develop a functional system and scale it as needed in the future.

**Example of a low-cost setup:**

- **e2-micro instances**: free within the _free tier_, perfect for testing and small projects
- **Preemptible VMs**: up to 80% cheaper, ideal for non-critical tasks
- **Customizable resources**: start with the minimum (10 GB disk, 1-2 GB RAM) and scale up only when necessary

## My Experience with EasyRecruiterOn

I'm currently using a Google Cloud VM to test the backend of my **EasyRecruiterOn** project, and the experience has been excellent. The platform is reliable, intuitive, and extremely affordable. Everything runs within the free credit with stable performance - which makes me even more excited to explore this infrastructure's full potential.

## Conclusion

Google Cloud gave me the freedom to learn, test ideas, and host projects without worrying about initial costs - and it goes far beyond just VMs. The platform offers services like managed databases, machine learning APIs, cloud storage, load balancers, and more.

If you want to experiment with VPS, learn about cloud computing, or validate a project professionally and economically, Google Cloud is one of the best choices available today.
