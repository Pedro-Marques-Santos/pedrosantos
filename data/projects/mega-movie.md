### Project Overview

Mega Movie is a website created to help users discover movies and series tailored to their tastes. The idea was to build a platform where people could not only find recommendations but also explore details about their favorite titles in an engaging way. Whether you're looking for something new to watch or want to dive deeper into a specific film, Mega Movie was designed to make the experience seamless and enjoyable.

Here’s what the site provided:

- **Search Functionality**: Users could easily look up any movie or series they wanted.
- **Trailers**: Watch trailers right on the site to preview titles before committing.
- **Platform Availability**: Find out which streaming services offer the movie or series.
- **Detailed Insights**: Explore in-depth details like genre, cast, and other key characteristics.

Sadly, the project is no longer active since the movie API it depended on was discontinued. That said, the code remains fully accessible for anyone who’d like to explore it or adapt it for their own use.

### Technical Details

Mega Movie was built with a combination of frontend and backend technologies to ensure a seamless user experience. The frontend was developed using Next.js, paired with Styled Components for styling, which allowed for a highly customizable and dynamic interface. On the backend, Node.js powered the server-side logic, managing user data and interactions efficiently. This setup made the site both visually appealing and functional.

Key technical highlights include:

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js for fast rendering and server-side capabilities
  - Styled Components for flexible, component-based styling
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js for server-side logic and API endpoints
  - MongoDB for flexible data storage
- **Additional Features**:
  - Local storage for temporary user preferences
  - Responsive design for all devices

The source code for both frontend and backend is available on GitHub:
