CacheWiper Pro is a test plugin I created for a freelance project. The client wanted a prototype to evaluate the feasibility of developing a cache-clearing plugin. This test was successful, and later, I developed a more advanced version tailored specifically for the client. The code provided here is part of that project, made available for anyone who wants to improve or adapt it for their development needs.

### Who is it for and why is it useful?

This plugin is highly useful for websites that need to clear cache quickly or schedule automatic cache clearing over time. It can also serve as a reference for developers looking to build their own cache-clearing plugins for their platforms, offering a practical example to build upon.

### License

This plugin is licensed under **GPLv2**. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute.

CacheWiper-Pro is open-source and
the [code is available at Github](https://github.com/Pedro-Marques-Santos/CacheWiper-Pro).
