<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">When will I be able to use this CRM?</h3>

<p><strong>EasyRecruiterOn</strong> is currently in beta, available for selected testers. Final adjustments are being made for deployment on a Google Cloud VPS, ensuring faster performance, stability, and security for all users.</p>

<p>With integrations using <strong>Firebase</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, the platform offers a smart and automated flow â€” from registration to full management of job listings and applications.</p>

<p>Our goal is to deliver a modern, practical, and accessible experience â€” both for those seeking new opportunities and for recruiters aiming to streamline their processes.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -0rem !important;"><strong>The public launch is coming soon!</strong> I'm excited to share this solution with the community and help connect talent seekers with opportunity seekers.</p>
